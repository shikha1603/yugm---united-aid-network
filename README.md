# 🌐 Yugm – People-to-People Support Platform (Design & UX Case Study)

> **Yugm** is a people-to-people support platform designed for times of crisis like floods, pandemics, earthquakes, or any emergency when government platforms are slow or overwhelmed. Unlike traditional platforms, **Yugm empowers everyday citizens** to offer and seek help  directly and efficiently.

# 🎯 Purpose

Yugm is built for crisis situations — floods, pandemics, earthquakes — where people need urgent help, and traditional systems are slow or inaccessible. This project presents the **UX research and design phase** of Yugm, a platform that enables people to **offer and receive support directly**.


## 🧠 UX Process

 1. 📝 Problem Statement  
In critical times such as natural disasters or pandemics, existing platforms like *MyGov* and *Arogya Setu*
are primarily government-driven.There is no **independent, people-to-people real-time support network** until now. 

Yugm fills this gap by enabling citizens to:
- Request help (food, shelter, medical aid, etc.)
- Offer help (volunteering, resources, transport)
- Connect safely and transparently through a verified platform

 2. 🔄 User Journey Map  
Identified pain points from **both help seekers and volunteers**.  
Included scenarios like:  
- Urgently needing food/water  
- Wanting to donate nearby  
- Fear of scams/lack of trust
